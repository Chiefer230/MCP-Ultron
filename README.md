# MCP-Ultron

Ultron is a LLM commincating via MCP (Model Context Protocol) inorder to execute specifc commands and have fucntionality. The goal of this project is to showcase MCP security (Authentication, Authorization, and Encryption) , LLM security and some red teaming implementaions into Ultron (Running nmap, Metasploit, Physical security Attacks).

Ultron's main brain is the Host Machine and his sub brains or extensions are IOT devices. For now his only extension is a raspberry pi 5 with 16gb of RAM and his Main Brain is an AMD 6600XT. Hopefully i can give him more resources with his Main Brain to expand is capability but that requires more finances.
